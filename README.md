# Introduction
In this lab we are going to implement the SJF Sheduling method using python and calculate the Completion, Waiting and Turn Around Time of each process.                  
We are also going to find the average Waiting and Turn Arounf Time.
# Working 
The program first take how many process are their in the queen, afterward take process id,Arrival and brust time, then exute the process arounding to SJF algorithum and give us the completion, waiting and turn around time of each process.
